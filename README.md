# Information Gain Filtration
Information Gain Filtration (IGF) is a method for filtering domain-specific data during language model finetuning. IGF shows significant improvements over baseline fine-tuning without data filtration. The provided Jupyter Notebook gives a simple demostration into the use of IGF during language model finetuning. Data for this demonstration is available on Figshare [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Information_Gain_Filtration_Demo_Code_Data/14905662).

If you use this method in your published work, please cite the ACL paper that describes this method [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00175).
