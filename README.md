# Information Gain Filtration
Information Gain Filtration (IGF) is a method for filtering domain-specific data during language model finetuning. IGF shows significant improvements over baseline fine-tuning without data filtration. This demo repo has now been moved to the HuggingFace research projects repo [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/research_projects/information-gain-filtration).
